Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `mt940` for local development.

1. Fork the `mt940` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone --branch develop git@github.com:your_name_here/mt940.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv mt940
    $ cd mt940/
    $ pip install -e .

4. Create a branch for local development with `git-flow-avh`_::

    $ git-flow feature start name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Or without git-flow:

    $ git checkout -b feature/name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ flake8 mt940 mt940_tests
    $ py.test
    $ tox

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv using the requirements file.

    $ pip install -r mt940_tests/requirements.txt

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub with `git-flow-avh`_::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git-flow feature publish

   Or without git-flow:

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push -u origin feature/name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, 3.4+, and for PyPy. Check
   https://travis-ci.org/WoLpH/mt940/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions. To
   test locally you can use `tox` which will run on all installed Python
   versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

	$ py.test mt940_tests/some_test.py
